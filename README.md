# ðŸ”¥ PNPM Monorepo Starter

A TypeScript monorepo using PNPM workspaces with four main packages:

- A Koa backend with JWT auth
- A React (vite) frontend
- A component library
- Shared types/utilities

## Motivation

**NOTE: The intent for this project is to be used to develop proof-of-concept applications**, _not_ to be production ready out of the box.

I hate setting up projects. I want to avoid all the boilerplate setup that usually derails motivation to go tackle an idea when you have a couple of spare hours.

### What this project does:

- Provide A web-client already configured with login/registration flows and private/public routes so you can get started as soon as you've connected to your database. You can also rip them out, up to you.
- Provide a RESTful API with a postgres pool connection, already configured with `auth` and `public` schema, including tables for `users` and `user_profiles`, respectively.
- Provide a design-system that is not dependent on any other design framework (i.e., Material or Shadcn/ui). Design systems change all the time and are usually pretty heavy for what they offer. This implementation exclusively with css modules for styling, theming and animations, augmented with `react-spring` for motion.
- Share types between `web-client` and `server` to encourage data integrity. **Note: this process is manual for now, I'll be implementing some form of codegen eventually**.

### What this project does not do:

- **Handle deployments and/or connect to cloud services**. There are too many variables to make an out-of-the-box deployment solution practical for most cases. This project is a BYO Infrastructure.
- **Send Emails**. Same reasoning as above.
- **Leverage an ORM**. ORMs are highly polarizing and in most cases I'd argue they're unnecessary for any reason outside of ergonomics. You can always add one if you want to, but the `server` contains a basic Database-interaction layer that covers the most common interactions.
- **Implement OAuth/Magic Link etc.**. The auth-service included in this project is basic and intended to be used to satisfy auth requirements for development purposes. The `AuthService` class is built as a black-box, intended to be replaced by whichever provider you prefer.
